When I first started learning web development with HTML and CSS, I was excited to bring my ideas to life, but it didn’t take long before I ran into some frustrating challenges.

During the early stages, I started with the basic structure of the site using HTML. I ensured that my content was well-organised using semantic elements like header, nav, main, and footer.
One of the biggest struggles I faced was getting my hamburger icon to work properly with the nav bar. No matter what I tried, it just wouldn’t function the way I wanted, despite having gone through it in lecture.

After hours of troubleshooting, I finally realised the issue—my CSS file was in a different folder, so it wasn’t linking correctly. That was a huge lesson in file organisation.
I also had a tough time working with CSS Grid. I wanted my layout to look professional, but figuring out the right structure and positioning was more complicated than I expected.
On top of that, I struggled with design ideas. I had a vision of making something sleek and professional, but as I kept running into obstacles, my work got more and more disorganised.
Eventually, I had to simplify everything and settle for a more basic design just to make it functional. 

It was a tough but valuable learning experience, and now I know the importance of planning, organisation, and debugging early on.

When designing my website, in terms of UI, I wanted a clean look while incorporating my top colours: red, blue, and black. These colors were chosen not just because I like them, 
but because they offer a bold and dynamic contrast that can make a website visually appealing. For font choice, I wanted something modern yet easy to read. I experimented with different basic fonts, but it wasn't till I went on Pinterest 
and found a Google font I quite liked: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+Glitch.

My website didnt really have much of an inspiration, I just wanted to create a simple and clean website that was easy to navigate. I wanted to make sure that the website was responsive and could be viewed on any device.
However, the little inspiration i had came from my recent interest in ethical hacking so thats another reason i used black, red, and blue, along with the glitch font.

Looking back at my experience with the Web Development module, I have to admit it hasn’t been the smoothest journey.
A big challenge I faced was procrastination—I kept putting off my assignments, thinking I had plenty of time, only to find myself rushing to complete tasks at the last minute. 
This made the learning process more stressful than it needed to be and probably held me back from fully grasping certain concepts.

Despite this, I did enjoy some aspects of the module, especially when I was able to see my work take shape on the screen. Learning how to structure a webpage with HTML and style it with CSS was interesting, but at times, I struggled with design choices and layout organization.
I wanted my project to look professional, but as deadlines approached and frustration set in, I ended up settling for a more basic version just to get it done.

One of the biggest lessons I’ve taken from this module is the importance of time management.
If I had started earlier and worked consistently, I would have had more time to experiment, improve my skills, and create something I was truly proud of.
Moving forward, I want to break my work into smaller, manageable tasks and avoid leaving everything to the last minute. Although my experience with this module wasn’t ideal, it has taught me valuable lessons that I can apply not just in web development,
but in other areas of my studies as well.
